I remember the release of Shrek 2. Shrek was essentially the minions of its time, people were obsessed with that green fucker and no man could get his fill of Shrek shit. When Shrek 2 happened, people were surprised to see that it wasn't just pandering, it was genuinely a funny movie. So, of course, with that success comes even MORE Shrek products. But here's the thing. Minions was set up to have good products. Little yellow tic-tacs are marketable and can have their bodies turned into any household object, such as a bottle of soap or a candy bar. Since the food constantly associated with the movie was bananas, a lot of good-tasting products actually came out of it. As for Shrek? Fucking. Green. What does that mean? Nobody was ever quite certain. Green Go-gurt that was changed to "O-gurt?" We had that. A new mint-flavored green McDonald's frozen treat with sexually suggestive advertising? The Mint Ogre-load was a thing you could put in your mouth. Twinkies with green filling? Goddammit, my grandma stole my fucking Twinkie and threw it away because she thought it was rotten, then apologized enthusiastically when I told her "it was just a Shrek Twinkie."
